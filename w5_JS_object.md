## String

A string stores a sequence of characters, with a zero based index. The characters can be enclosed in single or double quotes.

Strings can use the properties and methods of the String object. There are many properties and methods that are part of the String object.

You can find a list of them in the below String object reference. The reference includes interactive examples as well.

## Date

The Date object is used to work with dates and times and represents a single moment in time based on the

UNIX epoch - the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

There are many properties and methods available for working with the dates. Note that a date  must be instantiated 

e.g. ``` let d = new Date(); ```  

You can find a list of the methods and properties available to the Date object in the below reference. The reference includes interactive examples as well.

## Math

The Math object supports properties and methods for working with numbers. The methods and properties of the Math object are static, therefore you don't need to create 
an instance of the object before using them.  You can find a list of the methods and properties available to the Date object in the below reference. 
The reference includes interactive examples as well.
