## Functions
A function is a series of statements grouped together to accomplish a  task.

Functions can be reused and save time from writing the same code over and over.

There are two parts to working with a function: 1. Declaring a function 2. Calling a function.

Sometimes, in fact often, functions need information. This is referred to as the argument of the function.

Functions return information as well, with the use of the return statement.

## Objects
Objects create models of the real world by grouping together variables and functions. 

Variables and functions that are part of an object are called properties and methods.

Property and method consist of a name (also known as a key) and its corresponding value, or key-value pairs.

You can create your own object or use the built in objects available in JS, such as the Browser Object Model, the Document Object Model,
or the global JS Objects such as String or Math.
