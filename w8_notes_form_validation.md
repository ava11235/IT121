## Form validation, JSON, AJAX, APIs
## Reading

zyBooks Ch 8

Form data should  be checked for correctness in the browser before being submitted to the web server. 

Data validation is performed with the use of JS, either while the user enters the form data or when the user submits data to the server 
via the form handler (usually a .php file).

HTML5 provides a simple way of validating some form data with the use of attributes such as required, or by validating that a URL field has the required format.
Other types of validation, such as using negative numbers when not allowed, requires the use of JS.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of the work, students will be able to: 

* Validate user data in forms with JS
* Use Ajax to asynchronously contact a server and update a page with the response, without reloading the page.
* Call methods and properties of the XMLHttpRequest object.
* Use the JSON format to store data.
* Work with third party APIs.
