zyBooks Ch 1 JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript can make websites more interactive and user-friendly by accessing and modifying the content and markup of web pages as the user is viewing them.

This is accomplished by accessing content (selecting text, elements or attributes on the web page), modifying content (adding or removing text, elements, 
or attributes on the web page), by writing steps for the browser to follow, and by reacting to events by telling the script to run when a specific event 
(e.g. a mouse click) has occurred.

What is a script?  A script is a series of instructions that the  computer can follow to complete a task.
To write a script you define a task/requirement, split it in smaller sub-tasks, implement the sub tasks using a programming language such as JS.

How to write a JavaScript:

JS is written in plain text, as are HTML and CSS. 
You can add JS to your page in two ways: by adding a ``` <script> ``` tag in the head or before the closing body tag of the HTML page. 
When the browser encounters a ```<script> ``` element it stops to load the script and performs any actions indicated.

The code inside the ```<script> ``` tag can be embedded or in its own .js file, which is linked with with the ```<script src="filename"> ``` attribute.
