## jQuery
## Reading

zyBooks Ch 9.1 - 9.5 inclusive

jQuery is a script and a library written in JavaScript.

Once jQuery is added to a page, it can be used to select elements work with them. 

Select elements using CSS-style selectors such as:

``` jQuery('li.red'); ``` or the alternative, and often preferred syntax ```$('li.red')```

The jQuery object is created when an element or set of elements are selected. This object then contains references to those elements.

The jQuery object has properties and methods that can be used to work with the elements.

Once the element has been selected, a method can be called to work with it. 

 ```$('li.red').hide()```

jQuery properties and methods provide the ability to:
Select or find elements
Update element content, size, or visibility
Simplify the handling of  events
