### DOM Manipulation 
DOM Maniplation with jQuery allows for the accessing, removing, and manipulating of elements.

### AJAX 

Third party web APIs are provided by many companies for the purpose of accessing company data.
In most cases you need to obtain an API key in order to work with the API.

Many third party web APIs are restFul APIs. This means that the API is called with a URL including needed parameters and returns the data in JSOn or XML format.

### Plugins
Plugins are an easy way to add functionality to a web page. Examples include gallery, mobile navigation or form validation plugins.

One easy way to add widgets (visual plugins) to your website is with the use of jQuery UI, which is another jQuery library. Note that jQuery UI requires jQuery.
